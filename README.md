# tweets-stocks

In this repo, I want to build a website in which people can
input the name of a stock (or any other asset) and a word,
and get back a few charts showing recent trends
of that stock together with data from Twitter regarding
how much the given word has been tweeted recently
and tweet sentiment.

I am doing this only as a small personal projects, more oriented
towards experimenting with various deployment options
of something like this than anything, so feel free to use this code
at your own risk.

Possibly I will write an article about this in my
[blog](www.angioi.com)

Stay tuned ;-)
